**Synopsis:** Handle a hypercube of CLUMPY brightness
maps. Easy-to-use classes and functions are provided to interpolate
images in many dimensions (spanned by the model parameters), extract
monochromatic or multi-color images, as well as rotate images, zoom in
and out, apply PSFs, extract interferometric signals, etc.

**Example:**
For usage examples, please see [hypercat.ipynb](./hypercat.ipynb)
